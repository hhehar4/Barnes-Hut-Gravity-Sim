# Barnes-Hut-Gravity-Sim

An N-Body gravity simulator built using Python and Pygame. It implements the barnes-hut algorithm to approximate the positions of the individial bodies using a quadtree rather than brute forcing every calculation. The barnes-hut approximation has a time complexity of O(nlogn) whereas the standard brute force method would have a time complexity of O(n^2). You can toggle the visibility of the quadtree using the 't' key.
